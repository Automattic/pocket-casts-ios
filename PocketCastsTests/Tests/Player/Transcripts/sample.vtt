0:00:15.410 --> 0:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea

0:00:26.530 --> 0:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system,

0:00:30.690 --> 0:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,

0:00:33.330 --> 0:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,

0:00:37.770 --> 0:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because

0:00:41.610 --> 0:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences

0:00:45.050 --> 0:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain

0:00:49.050 --> 0:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure

0:00:52.610 --> 0:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious

0:00:57.850 --> 0:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right

0:01:02.610 --> 0:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,

0:01:07.650 --> 0:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>or one who avoids a pain

0:01:11.890 --> 0:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that produces no resultant pleasure?
