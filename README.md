    Pocket Casts is the world's most powerful podcast platform, an app by listeners, for listeners.
</p>

## Setup

If you don't already have it, you need to install Bundler:

`gem install bundler`

Next you'll need to install all the dependencies needed for CocoaPods and FastLane using this script:

`make install_dependencies`

## External contributors

If you're an external contributor run `make external_contributor`. After that you should be able to build and run the project.

## Swift Formatting

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure code is spaced and formatted the same way and follows the same [general conventions](https://github.com/Automattic/swiftlint-config). We have a script that will run it over the whole project.

Once the required dependencies are installed via `bundle exec pod install`, you can run:

`make format`

You should do this before making a pull request.

## Running

Open the .xcworkspace file, select the Pocket Casts project and the Simulator Device you want to run on, and hit the play button.

## Localization

You can learn more about localization at [docs/Localization.md](./docs/localization.md)

## Protocol Buffers

The app uses [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to define our server objects.

To update server objects you'll need to install the protobuf command line tool as well as the [Swift Protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) translators. This can be done via Homebrew with:

```
brew install protobuf
brew install swift-protobuf
```

To update the protobuf files you can then run:

Replace the `{API_PATH}` with the full path to the `pocketcasts-api/api/modules/protobuf/src/main/proto` folder

```
make update_proto API_PATH={API_PATH}
```
