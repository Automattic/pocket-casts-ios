# It rebuilds various CI caches on a periodic async basis, so as not to waste

  # Because this repo is large (~2m 20s to checkout), we periodically create a
  # Git Mirror and copy it to S3, from where it can be fetched by agents more
  # quickly than from GitHub, and so that agents then have less new commits to
  # `git pull` by using that cache as starting point.
