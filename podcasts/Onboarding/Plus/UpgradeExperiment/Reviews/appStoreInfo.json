I love that it syncs across devices so I can start listening on my phone and then pick up on an Alexa device. It's my recommendation for anyone who listens to podcasts. Also love the stats!",

There have been some complaints about the Ul change but I haven't really noticed it too much.\n\nThis app can be as simple or difficult to use as you'd like it to be. So either let it be a plug and play or set up skip outro and intro timers and any other little feature you want to enable.",

Easy to find new podcasts to listen to, very nice Ul, can add podcasts by rss feed url too. The watch app is functional, but I mostly use for my play/pause. Sign in with an account to sync across devices but no requirement to do so.",
