            I've been a Pocket Casts user since 2017.

            This is hands down the best app to listen to podcasts. It's feature rich and actively developed. There have been some complaints about the Ul change but I haven't really noticed it too much.

            This app can be as simple or difficult to use as you'd like it to be. So either let it be a plug and play or set up skip outro and intro timers and any other little feature you want to enable.

Easy to find new podcasts to listen to, very nice Ul, can add podcasts by rss feed url too. The watch app is functional, but I mostly use for my play/pause. Sign in with an account to sync across devices but no requirement to do so.",
