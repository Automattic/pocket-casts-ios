import SwiftUI


/// This is a helper view that allows you to run code inline of SwiftUI without needing to move logic into .onAppear
/// It works by creating a completely empty view, waiting for .onAppear, and then trigering the action. Once the action
/// has been triggered, the emptyview is replaced with a Group to prevent any possible layout issues
/// Example Usage:
///
/// ```
///  ZStack{
///     Action { print("debugging is cool ðŸ˜Ž") }
///     VStack {
///         ... some views ...
///     }
///
///     ... some views ...
///
///     Action {
///         viewModel.loadContent()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
