- Wrote 600 lines of Objective-C to do the above, and then wept a bit. The app is now only 92.33% Swift. :(
- This version might have a few playback bugs
- Added new playback option: Default Row Action. We figure it's important for people to be able to download as their main thing if they want, so it's back
- Updated profile page
- Moved downloads to Profile page
- Added starred to Profile page. This will show you everything you've starred regardless of subscriptions. I say 'will' because tapping it does nothing right now
- Added buferring state to the mini player, so you can see when things are, well, buffering

### 7.0 Build 552:
- Fixed the edit email option not working in the support section
- Fixed another crash in an effort to get to 0. Probably futile. Trying anyway
- Added support for regional popular charts to discover

### 7.0 Build 551:
- Hopefully fixed one of the longest running Pocket Casts bugs in history (background crash when disconnecting audio source) THIRD TIMES A CHARM! COME ONE WE GOT THIS! ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
- Added first cut of new categories back into discover section. Again, none of the discover section is final design, but it should work

### 7.0 Build 550:
- Removed 'Stream By Default' setting and trying to live in 2018. The app now streams by default. You can still download things by setting up Auto Download or tapping an episode and tapping the download button. You can configure Auto Download for your Up Next list, Podcast or even in filters (that last one isn't in there yet, but it will be). Please give this new feature a few days and then let us know how you feel about it, we realise it could be contraversial for some.
- Interim Discover section as we move to a new more dynamic design we can update frequently and better. For now it's missing categories and the design is not final but it should be usable
- Fixed an issue with Japanese title's and our TitleShortenator(TM)
- Hopefully fixed one of the longest running Pocket Casts bugs in history (background crash when disconnecting audio source)
- Fixed: Archived episodes are no longer considered when sorting your podcast grid by latest episode
- Fixed: Unarchiving an episode now counts towards it not being stale

### 7.0 Build 548:
- App no longer auto archives episodes on upgrade
- Auto archive now handles old episodes properly
- Archive all now, archives all (previously had old logic for auto migration archiving)
- Added message when hiding/showing archived episodes
- Fixed some of the more bizarre animations

### 7.0 Build 547:
- Experimenting with a new concept: Archiving.
  - If there's episodes you don't want to see or are done with, you can archive them.
  - Archiving an episode won't change where you are up to in it, or mark it as played, so there's no confusion about if you have or haven't listened to something
  - Archived episodes always have their files deleted, so when you archive something you automatically get back the storage space it was taking up.
  - Episodes you finish playing will be automatically archived after being played. You can however change this in settings to be after 24 hours or even longer.
  - Auto Cleanup has been replaced with Auto Archive, and you can choose rules for that in settings. You can no longer set this per podcast (since it's now time based there's no need to) but you can opt a podcast out of auto archiving.
  - Archived episodes do not appear in your filters and do not count towards your badge numbers
  - As a once off migration step, episodes you currently have that are played, but not interacted with in other ways (like downloaded or starred) will be automatically archived for you

- Fixed crash on Downloads Page
- Fixed episodes on Downloads page going slightly under the mini player
- Slightly improved podcast header expand/collapse animation
- In theory if a podcast you subscribe to adds older episodes, or changes episode details the app will now pick those up. In practice this will probably introduce all sorts of fun new bugs!
- Fixed an issue where you could tap on a podcast in discover and not subscribe, then weeks later go back and the podcast wouldn't be up to date
- Trying out adding haptic feedback to skip & play functions on Apple watch.

### 7.0 Build 531:
- Podcasts will now have their titles, descriptions, links, etc updated if they have changed. For now this runs every time you open a podcast page, but we'll make that more efficient later
- Podcasts that didn't previously have estimated release schedules and times because you had them before we had that feature, now will
- Replaced more legacy code with new shiny code that's probably full of bugs
- Standardised row heights in the settings area
- Tweaked the way we do episode list headings to make them stick, but also to only use them for significant date changes, eg: you should see way less of them

- Fixed a bug where the app would pause/play (or 'glitch' in beta testing speak :) when you enter and exit the iMessage picture browser
- Implemented the player side of the player speed improvements. The EffectsPlayer (the one we use for Trim Silence and Volume Boost) now starts playback much faster than it did before. This means that hitting play inside the app should now be faster (whether you're playing something new, or just unpausing content). Please note that this doesn't address hitting play from Control Centre when the app has been killed. This is because the app itself has to be launched before it can process the play event. On an iPhone 5S the app takes approximately 0.8 seconds to launch. My next challenge will be to see if I can speed that up!
